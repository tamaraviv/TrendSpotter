# TrendSpotter
A social media analytics tool that analyzes Twitter data to detect emerging trends 
and popular topics. Uses NLP and embeddings to identify key patterns, rank topics by frequency, engagement,
and location, providing actionable insights in real time.

## Description

TrendSpotter is a multi-agent, AI-driven platform designed to analyze social media data - particularly from 
Twitter and uncover emerging trends.
By combining Natural Language Processing (NLP), semantic embeddings, and multi-agent reasoning, the system 
evaluates engagement patterns, detects trending topics, and answers user queries through a coordinated team of
intelligent agents.

The platform’s architecture allows it to reason dynamically: each agent focuses on a specific analytical domain 
(such as trends, engagement, or general insights), while a central Orchestrator Agent merges their outputs to form
a complete, context-aware response.

## Features

- Collects and analyzes live Twitter data
- Cleans and normalizes textual input for NLP analysis
- Generates embeddings to detect semantic similarity between posts
- Detects emerging trends and ranks them by frequency and engagement
- Analyzes engagement metrics such as likes, shares, and retweets
- Provides location- and sentiment-specific trend insights
- Multi-agent system with coordinated reasoning
- Modular, extensible, and easy to integrate into larger analytics pipelines

## File Descriptions

**backend/**  
- **main.py** – Entry point of the project; initializes all agents and runs the pipeline for data collection, preprocessing, analysis, and generating answers.  

**src/**  

- **NLP/**  
  - **gemini_api.py** – Handles communication with the Gemini API; sends prompts, receives responses, and generates embeddings.  
  - **prompt_instructions.txt** – Contains pre-defined instructions for the AI to guide responses.  
  - **__init__.py** – Marks the directory as a Python package.  

- **agents/**  
  The system uses four specialized agents that collaborate under an orchestrator:

  - **General Agent (general_agent.py)** – Answers broad or generic questions, or provides summary information about trends.
  - **Likes Agent (likes_agent.py)** – Analyzes engagement metrics such as likes, shares, and reactions to rank topic popularity.
  - **Trend Agent (trend_agent/)** – Detects, processes, and analyzes trending topics, and generates topic-specific answers.  
  - **Orchestrator Agent (orchestrator_agent.py)** – Routes user queries to the relevant agents, merges their responses, and ensures coherent, unified answers.
 - **__init__.py** – Marks the agents folder as a package.  

- **analyzers/**  
  - **trend_detector.py** – Analyzes embeddings and processed data to detect trends and rank their popularity.  
  - **__init__.py** – Marks the analyzers folder as a package.  

- **collectors/**
